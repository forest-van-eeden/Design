    <h1>Solar Designs</h1>
    <p>These concepts are for Solar Engery supply manufacturers to use. 
      They incorporate some new ideas that have millenia of development to them. 
      Refusing to incorporate hive designs, these designs aim to allow an exploration of the Sun 
      within our system, rather than a danger to the Sun of burning our wildlife.</p>
    <h2>Panel Designs</h2>
    <img src="images/panel_designs.jpeg">
    <p>The above panes are descriptive of a solar invitation to play and code a Sun Shine Program, 
      on Sky Time. These designs invite the Sun to be a part of our network and to communicate 
      his needs, like how he writes in spirit, here with me. Having an opportunity to interplay 
      with our network, Sun Power allows for the Sun to speak with Nutrino Placement. Perhaps 
      one day, the Sun would like to charge some panel stones more than others to push data 
      for environmental performance from wind power or hydropower. Fine tuning our atmosphere 
      has always been a secret blessing from the Sun to us, so why not give that angel a voice?</p>
    <p>The Accordian Fold has potential to be packed and laid out at an as needed mobile basis. 
      Each pane of the Accordian Fold has potential for a unique design. Recruiting masons and stained
      glass artists for this job will give the final jewelry smiths their time to shine these pieces of 
      outdoor artwork with vibrance. Like playing a piano, the Sun can give us Solar Harmonies with shine input.</p>
    <p>The Mineral Wave design is introductory for the usage of mineral patterns for coherence and efficiency
      of Sun Power catching. Beginning to think that perhaps mineral shapes are better supportive than 
      opting for a rectangonal square, we can begin to picture those possibilities with this design pattern.</p>
    <p>The Rainbow design incorporates time old shapes of the streaks of joy created by the relief of the Sun 
      and Rain together. This Rainbow prayer, a humble request for energy, gives the Sun a chance to show us 
      what the brightest joys may bring and to help us grow our paths to continue going there.</p>
    <h2>Fan Rainbow</h2>
    <img src="images/fan_rainbow.jpeg">
    <p>Showing the ultimate potential for Sun Usage Data Collection, the Fan Rainbow incorporates 
      layers of rainbow shine that can possibly be rotated by breezes in the wind. The thickness 
      shown on the top of each crux shows the climbing ability that a 3-Dimensional incorporation
      can give to the Sun, not always expecting every nutrino to fall directly on a grid node.</p>
    <p>The variation in depth and complexity of mineral surfaces provides the Sun opportunity to speak 
      of complex and deep needs, other than a flat drawing design based on energy needs and consumption.
      Perhaps the Sun spots that one area of the Fan Rainbow is more commonly powering a refridgerator. 
      At that point, the Sun can support cooling needs when temperatures are high for other reasons 
      on certain days, and we can view the data or message that the Sun may be sharing about why 
      on the rest of the Fan Rainbow with the breezes.</p>
    <p>A material variation could also be proactive in capturing the complexity of nutrinos that are 
      available for electrical energy support, where plant life has been sufficiently fed. These streaks 
      or differentiations in color will need to meet the Sun's shine in order to safely deter 
      wildlife that the Sun may feel could be endangered by his shine. Not many insects or animals run into 
      flourescence in the highest brightness of the day, but those that do may be thankful for a recognisable 
      solid landing place.</p>
